    <p>Think you're lucky? Simulate playing the Australian Gold Lotto to find out!</p>
    <p>
        The rules are simple: pick 6 unique numbers between 1 and 45 
        (or hit the random button to pick random numbers for you) and throw in some money. 
        It will simulate draws and pay out your winning draws. 
        The money won is added to your balance and used to play more (until you run out of money).
    </p>
    <p>For the more advanced users you can also play System and Pick games.</p>
    <p>You can change the speed at which draws are generated and expand your winning draws at the bottom.</p>
    <p>You can view the list at the very bottom.</p>
